Mays JC, Kelly MC, Coon SL, Holtzclaw L, Rath MF, et al. (2018) Single-cell RNA sequencing of the mammalian pineal gland identifies two pinealocyte subtypes and cell type-specific daily patterns of gene expression. PLOS ONE 13(10): e0205883.

# Running the Analysis Code
Single-Cell RNA-Seq analysis was performed using [Seurat](github.com/satijalab/seurat) v2.2.0. 
Code should be run in the follow order:
## Setup
`SetupDependencies.R` loads libraries, `MetadataInit.R` loads a helper function used in later scripts.
```
./Scripts/SetupDependencies.R
./Scripts/MetadataInit.R 
```
## Single Samples
These R Notebooks contain the analysis code for each individual sample.
```
./Day1.Rmd
./Day2.Rmd
./Night1.Rmd
./Night2.Rmd
```
## Combined Samples
These R Notebooks contain the code that combines the treatment samples and applies a refined analysis. 
```
./Day1n2_NoDoublets.Rmd
./Night1n2_NoDoublets.Rmd
```
## Reference Genome Correction
The `3PrimeExtensionCorrection.R` script applies corrected count values to the Seurat objects. Corrected count values were generated by re-aligning the sequencing data using a manually updated genomic reference. 
```markdown
./Scripts/3PrimeExtensionCorrection.R
```

## Figures

These scripts were used to generate the figures for the paper.

```
./Scripts/Figure_01.R
./Scripts/Figure_03.R
```
